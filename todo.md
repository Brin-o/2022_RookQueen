bugs:
- [ ] attacking an enemy 
- [ ] bishop does not move on his turn
- [x] rook richoche 
- [ ] spike2 in spikes needs to be set to z index 0 if noone is currently on the tile
- [ ] in some weird secnario bishop thinks he can not move? usually seems to happen after an allied bishop has been knocked out
- [Â ] the only way to place down a piece should be by putting it in the same place

todo:
- [x] spike tiles
- [ ] key/door tile
- [ ] end of level tiles
- [x] level swapping DONEish
- [ ] piece swapping between level
- [ ] display which tiles the bishop will attack
- [ ] display hovered tiles
- [x] bishop should attack in a + pattern instead of X
- [x] pawn upgrade to random piece after reaching the end
- [x] timer between player move and enemy move
- [x] in base piece call set_active_piece(true) if this is the next piece that will perform a turn
- [ ] solution for horse/horse? start spawning spikes on the outer edges of the map basically doing a bomber man style thing?
- [x] implement queen
- [x] implement king
- [ ] make rook move all the way
- [ ] make characters attack if they can
- [ ] change level to ysort
