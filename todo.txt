bugs:
- attacking an enemy 
- bishop does not move on his turn
- rook richoche 
- spike2 in spikes needs to be set to z index 0 if noone is currently on the tile

todo:
- spike tiles DONE
- key/door tile
- end of level tiles
- level swapping DONEish
- piece swapping between level
- display which tiles the bishop will attack
-- bishop should attack in a + pattern instead of X
- pawn upgrade to random piece after reaching the end
- timer between player move and enemy move
